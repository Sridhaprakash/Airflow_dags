SubDAGs
Overview
SubDAGs (SubDAGOperators) in Apache Airflow allow you to encapsulate and organize a group of tasks within a DAG. This is particularly useful when you have a set of related tasks that you want to group together, making your DAGs more modular and easier to manage.

TaskGroups
Overview
TaskGroups in Apache Airflow provide another way to organize and visually group related tasks within a DAG. They offer a higher-level abstraction for grouping tasks than SubDAGs and are particularly useful for organizing tasks within a single DAG file.
